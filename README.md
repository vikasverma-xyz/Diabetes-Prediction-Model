# Diabetes Prediction Model

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Model repository! This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning algorithms. The model is built using Python and leverages various libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy.

## Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction Model is designed to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on a set of medical attributes. The primary objective is to provide an accurate and reliable tool for early detection of diabetes, which can be used by healthcare professionals for diagnostic purposes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome), which indicates whether the individual is diabetic.

### Attributes

1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age: Age (years)
9. Outcome: Class variable (0: non-diabetic, 1: diabetic)

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction-model
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the diabetes prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have installed all dependencies as mentioned in the Installation section.
2. Run the script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Use the trained model to make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/input.csv --output data/output.csv
   ```

## Model Training

The model training script (`train_model.py`) performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the dataset.
2. Preprocesses the data (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
5. Saves the trained model to a file.

## Evaluation

The model evaluation script (`evaluate_model.py`) assesses the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It also generates a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance.
